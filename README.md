# Garbage Classification using EfficientNet V2 B2

This project aims to classify garbage into categories like biodegradable and non-biodegradable using EfficientNet V2 B2. This is part of an internship project under EduNet.

## Week 1 Progress
- Created project structure
- Collected and organized initial dataset samples
- Visualized some data samples and class distribution

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Sample images from dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and future model training
- `models/`: Will contain trained models and checkpoints

## Next Steps
- Full dataset loading
- EfficientNet V2 B2 model training setup
